export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Hi! I'm a passionate frontend developer and a soon-to-be graduate currently exploring the ever-evolving world of web development. My main focus is on frontend technologies, where I strive to build intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces.

I'm constantly learning and upskilling, diving deep into modern frontend tech stacks. Recently, I've been exploring Next.js, ShadCN, and other extra libraries to enhance my development workflow. While frontend development is my primary strength, I'm also expanding my knowledge of backend technologies, mainly focusing on the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack to become a more well-rounded developer.

As I step into the professional world, I'm excited to work on challenging projects, collaborate with like-minded developers, and contribute to innovative solutions. Let's build something amazing together!`;
