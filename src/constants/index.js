export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Passionate Frontend Developer skilled in crafting responsive web applications using React.js, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. Experienced in fullstack projects, real-time systems, and modern tooling with clean code and scalable architecture.

I'm constantly learning and upskilling, diving deep into modern frontend tech stacks. Recently, I've been exploring Next.js 15, Shadcn UI, and other extra libraries to enhance my development workflow. While frontend development is my primary strength, I'm also expanding my knowledge of backend technologies, mainly focusing on the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack to become a more well-rounded developer.

As I step into the professional world, I'm excited to work on challenging projects, collaborate with like-minded developers, and contribute to innovative solutions. Let's build something amazing together!`;
